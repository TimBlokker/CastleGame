# CastleGame

This repository contains a small java game developed for a course in the master of Bioinformatics at the KU Leuven. 
The aim of this game is to find the 3 necessary keys to enter a castle. Once all keys are found the castle can be "captured" 
and the game is won. On the quest the hero can collect potions and has to fight enemys.
